// Asynchronous Programming in Dart
// Asynchronous programming is a way of writing code that allows a program to do multiple tasks at the same time.


// Synchronous Programming in Dart
// In synchronous programming, the program is executed line by line, one at a time.
// Synchronous means that a task needs to be solved before proceeding to the next one.

// In asynchronous programming, program execution continues to the next line without waiting to complete other work.
// It simply means, dont wait.
// It represents the task that doesn't need to be solved before proceeding to the next one.
// Asynchronous programming improves the responsiveness of the program.

// Asynchronous is needed:
  // To fetch data from the internet
  // To write something to database
  // To execute a time consuming task
  // To read data from a file
  // To download a file

// Such asynchronous operations usually take a long time to complete, so it usually provides results in the form of a 'Future'.


// Future in Dart
// In dart, 'Future' represents a value or error that is not yet available.
// It is used to represent a potential value, or error, that will be available at some point in the future.
